# CURD WITH JAVA EE (JAKARTA EE)


## What is this project for? 

This project allows to do simple CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations with and without a database

## Status

#####Version 1.0 : Without a database
Obviously, some usage are depreciated. Even JAVA EE has been renamed to JAKARTA EE

#####Version 2.0 : UPDATED TO A VERSION WITH A DATABASE
So before installing this project (The version with a database), I recommend to create a database named as you want, then change the default references in db/JdbcConnection.java
